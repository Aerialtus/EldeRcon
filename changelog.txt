v5

Added the server list manager, which you can use to:
* Add multiple servers easily 
* Set nicknames for your servers
* Set servers to automatically connect when the program starts.

I also fixed the kick/message buttons, which I broke at some point.

v4

Added tabs!

v3

Added the player list + player command buttons.

v2

Added saving/loading servers you connect to. Gave it an icon to help it stick out.
