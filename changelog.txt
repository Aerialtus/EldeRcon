v7

Added optional encryption (AES-256) to protect server information.
You'll be prompted for your password: 
	* When you start the program
	* When you open the server manager
	* If you decide to decrypt the server information

Please keep in mind that your password is still sent in cleartext (as far as I know) to the server.
This change makes it more difficult for someone to see the passwords stored on disk (which will make more sense in a future update).

v6

Added ability to log joins/leaves and when games start/finish
Added a box to show the connection command for your server.
Added a copy button to copy the connection command. You can paste this in the game console to connect to your server.

v5

Added the server list manager, which you can use to:
	* Add multiple servers easily 
	* Set nicknames for your servers
	* Set servers to automatically connect when the program starts.

I also fixed the kick/message buttons, which I broke at some point.

v4

Added tabs!

v3

Added the player list + player command buttons.

v2

Added saving/loading servers you connect to. Gave it an icon to help it stick out.


v1

Basic functionality (can connect to a server, send commands, get responses, etc.)
